## File Structure

### Generated Files
- `.version-history.json` - Complete version tracking data
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Human-readable changelog
- Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.1`) - Standard semantic version tags

### Scripts
- `scripts/version-manager.js` - Enhanced version management
- `scripts/version-check.js` - Basic version utilities
- `scripts/release.js` - Complete release workflow

## Conventional Commit Analysis

The system recognizes these commit patterns:

### Breaking Changes
- Commits with "breaking" in message or body
- Suggests **major** version bump

### New Features
- Commits starting with "feat:" or "feature:"
- Suggests **minor** version bump

### Bug Fixes
- Commits starting with "fix:"
- Suggests **patch** version bump

### Other Categories
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Test additions/modifications
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `security:` - Security fixes

## Changelog Format

Generated changelog entries include:

```markdown
## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-28

Release description here

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change description ([abc123](../../commit/abc123))

### ‚ú® New Features  
- üéâ Feature description ([def456](../../commit/def456))

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- üîß Bug fix description ([ghi789](../../commit/ghi789))

### üîí Security

```

## Version History Schema

The `.version-history.json` file tracks:

```json
{
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "type": "patch",
      "description": "Fix critical bug",
      "date": "2025-05-28T...",
      "commits": 3,
      "commitDetails": [...],
      "previousVersion": "1.0.0",
      "semverIncrease": "patch"
    }
  ],
  "lastRelease": {...},
  "totalReleases": 1,
  "created": "2025-05-28T...",
  "updated": "2025-05-28T..."
}
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The version management system integrates with:

### GitHub Workflows
- Triggers on version tags
- Automatically publishes to npm
- Builds and pushes Docker images
- Updates release notes

### Release Workflow
1. Make commits using conventional format
2. Run `npm run version:bump` for interactive release
3. Or use `npm run version:patch "description"` for quick fixes
4. Push changes and tags: `git push origin main --tags`
5. GitHub Actions automatically handles publishing

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: update API documentation
chore: update dependencies
```

### Release Workflow
1. **Development**: Make commits using conventional format
2. **Review**: Use `npm run version:status` to see suggestions
3. **Release**: Use `npm run version:bump` for interactive selection
4. **Publish**: Push tags to trigger automated publishing

### Version Strategy
- **Patch** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Major** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0): Breaking changes, API changes

## Troubleshooting

### No Commits Since Last Tag
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è No commits found since last tag. Nothing to release.
```
**Solution**: Make some commits before attempting a release.

### Git Repository Not Initialized
```bash
‚ùå Command failed: git log --pretty=format...
```
**Solution**: Initialize git repository and make initial commit.

### Version History Missing
The system automatically creates `.version-history.json` on first use.

### Commit Analysis Issues
Ensure commits follow conventional commit format for best results.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Version Types
The system supports:
- `patch` - Bug fixes
- `minor` - New features
- `major` - Breaking changes  
- `prerelease` - Alpha/beta releases

### Bulk Version Information
```bash
# Get all version info at once
npm run version:status && npm run version:history
```

### Integration with Scripts
The version manager can be imported and used programmatically:

```javascript
const VersionManager = require('./scripts/version-manager');
const manager = new VersionManager();

// Get smart suggestion
const suggestion = await manager.suggestNextVersion();
console.log(`Suggested: ${suggestion.version} (${suggestion.type})`);
```

## Migration from Legacy System

If upgrading from basic npm versioning:

1. The system maintains compatibility with existing npm version commands
2. Run `npm run version:status` to initialize version history tracking
3. Existing git tags are recognized and integrated
4. Previous changelog entries are preserved

This enhanced version management system provides professional-grade release management suitable for open source projects and enterprise development workflows.
